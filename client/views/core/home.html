      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>If you're reading this, the end is almost here. I can't tell you how much fun I had making this app and sharing it with you. If you enjoyed it, a quick text would make my day. I know the app has been broken-ish since I graduated but I've made one last attempt to get it working again. I'm sure at some point it will fail, probably for the last time.</p>
      <p>Thanks for playing.</p>
