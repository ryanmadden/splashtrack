      <div class="collapsible-body"><p>The rating system has been upgraded to more fairly reward high performing players. Rating changes after a game are calculated based on your performance relative to other players in the game and their respective skill levels. Increasing your rating is simple: hit more caps than anyone else in your game.</p><p>You may notice your ranking has changed suddenly. After the system upgrade all ratings were reset to 800. Each rated game was then retroactively evaluated to create the current rankings.</p></div>
